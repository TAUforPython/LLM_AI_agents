A compact, hands-on course and reference for building LLM-powered AI agents — from single-step inference to multi-agent coordination, tool integration (MCP), and retrieval-augmented pipelines (HyDE).

This repository is organized as executable Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate patterns, example code, and experiments. Notebooks target both local inference (Mistral / local LLMs) and cloud APIs (Mistral cloud, OpenAI).

## What you'll learn

| Lesson | Topic | Key technique / tool |
|--------|-------|----------------------|
| 1-2 | Basic & Llama inference | Mistral, OpenAI, Llama |
| 3 / 3A | Simple agents & MCP emulation | LangChain, MCP examples |
| 4 | MCP Tools | Model Context Protocol (tool wrapping, tool loop) |
| 5 | Memory & Guardrails | Conversation buffers, content safety |
| 6 | Multi-Agent | Critic + Coordinator pattern |
| 7 | Answer scoring | Automated evaluation metrics |
| 8 | RAG techniques | Naive, advanced, and query transformations |
| 9 | DSPy components | Programmatic LM pipelines (DSPy) |
| 10 | TAO (Think-Act-Observe) | ReAct-like loop with LLM + tools |
| 11-13 | Applied projects | Medical claims, fact-checking, HyDE for clinical guidelines |

> All notebooks are executable. Many include Colab launch badges (open in Colab) and API setup notes.

## Key concepts covered

- MCP (Model Context Protocol): standardized tool and resource descriptions so an LLM can call external capabilities safely and consistently (see lesson-4_MCP_tools.ipynb).
- HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings): generate a hypothetical answer to form better retrieval queries (see lesson-13_HyDE_Russian_Clinical_Guidelines.ipynb).
- Agent Patterns: TAO / ReAct loops, single-agent with guardrails + memory, and explicit multi-agent patterns (coordinator, critic, workers).

Notes:
- The repository is notebook-first: there is no top-level package or service. Notebooks are the primary artifacts.
- Filenames may include small spelling variants (e.g., `MultyAgent` in lesson-6); filenames reflect the committed names.

## How it fits together

Each lesson is an independent notebook that can be run in order to follow a learning path. Early lessons demonstrate inference and basic usage (Mistral, OpenAI), mid lessons introduce tools and agent loops (MCP, LangChain, LangGraph), and later lessons apply multi-agent patterns and retrieval techniques to domain problems (medical claims, HyDE retrieval).

## Quick start

Minimum recommended environment:
- Python 3.10+ (3.11 tested)
- A recent pip

From a fresh clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/D2718281828nis/LLM_AI_agents.git
cd LLM_AI_agents
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate     # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip

# install the common dependencies used by the notebooks (some notebooks install extras inline)
pip install mistralai langchain openai dspy chromadb jupyter colab
```

Environment / secrets (examples used in notebooks):

```text
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Running notebooks:
- Open in Jupyter Lab/Notebook: `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` and open the notebook you want to run.
- Many notebooks include a Colab launch badge; you can open them in Google Colab and provide secrets via the Colab secrets/userdata UI.

Run a single notebook headlessly (example):

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute lesson-4_MCP_tools.ipynb --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600
```
